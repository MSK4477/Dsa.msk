chaining : it is just like an linked list if an row was already occupied it will add the elment next to that element [1] --> [2] --> [3] like this like an linked list ,


open Addressing : this is like we linearly search the empty area and then put the element there we store each and every element in the unique slot 

if an slot is empty we not leave it like that we just mark it as an empty this is use for deletion of the element if an slot was empty then it was make an confusion while deleting the element so we can make that as an "empty"


double hashign we can do hasing untill we get the empty space this one is the best method out of all the methods that we spoken
